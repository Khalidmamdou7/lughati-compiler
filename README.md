# Lughati Compiler

Lughati Compiler is a compiler for the Lughati programming language. Lughati is a high-level programming language designed for general-purpose programming, with an emphasis on readability and ease of use. It is designed by us as a part of our final project for the course "Compilers" at Cairo University. 

"Lughati" is an Arabic word (لغتي) that means "my language".
